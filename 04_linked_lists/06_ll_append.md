# Linked list append

adding item wasn't in the list

last item so we will make the tail point to the new node
if we don't have any item in the linked list will make the head and tail to point to the new node

class Node:
def **init** (self, value)
self.value = value
self.

class LinkedList :
def **init** (self, value)
new_node = Node()
self.head = new_node
self.tail = new_node
self.length = 1
