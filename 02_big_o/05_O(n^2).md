# Big O Example: O(n²)

## Example: Nested Loops

```python
def print_items(n):
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            print(i, j)

print_items(10)
```

### Explanation

- The function prints **all pairs of `i` and `j`** from 0 to n-1.
- For `n = 10`, it prints **100 items** → `10 * 10`.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n²) because there are **two nested loops**, each running `n` times.
- **Graph Interpretation:** The runtime grows steeply as `n` increases, so this algorithm is **less efficient** compared to O(n) for large inputs.
