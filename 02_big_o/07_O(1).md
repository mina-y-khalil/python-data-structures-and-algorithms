# Big O Example: O(1) – Constant Time

## Example

```python
def add_items(n):
    return n + n + n

print(add_items(10))
```

### Explanation

- Only **one operation** is performed, regardless of the size of `n`.
- **Time Complexity:** O(1) – **constant time**
- Even if `n` is a million, the operation count **does not increase**.
- **Graph Interpretation:** The runtime is a **flat line**, making O(1) the **most efficient Big O** in terms of time complexity.
