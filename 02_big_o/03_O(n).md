# Big O – O(n) Notes

## 1. Overview

- **O(n)** is the simplest and most intuitive time complexity.
- Also called **linear time complexity** because the execution time grows **proportionally** with input size `n`.

## 2. Example in Python

```python
def print_items(n):
    for i in range(n):
        print(i)

print_items(10)
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The function iterates **once for each item** in the input `n`.
  - If `n` increases, the number of operations increases **linearly**.

## 3. Graph Behavior

- The time vs input size graph is a **straight line**.
- Execution time is **proportional to `n`**.
- This is why it’s called **linear time complexity**.
