# Time and Space Complexity Cases Notes

## 1. Key Symbols

- When analyzing **time and space complexity**, there are three main symbols:
  1. **Ω (Omega)** – Best-case scenario
  2. **Θ (Theta)** – Average-case scenario
  3. **O (Big O)** – Worst-case scenario

## 2. Examples

- Consider a list with **7 numbers**:
  - Searching for the **first number** → **Best case** → Ω
  - Searching for the **last number** → **Worst case** → O (Big O)
  - Searching for a number somewhere in the middle → **Average case** → Θ

## 3. Important Notes

- **Big O** always refers to the **worst-case scenario**.
- There is no “best” or “average” case when referring specifically to **Big O**.
- Use Ω to describe best-case efficiency and Θ for average-case efficiency.
